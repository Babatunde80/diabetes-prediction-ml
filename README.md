## Project Overview
A machine learning-based system for predicting diabetes risk using clinical health indicators. This project leverages on **Supervised Machine Learning** algorithms to provide accurate predictions and help in early detection of diabetes, supporting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

**Industry:** Healthcare / Medical Technology

## Executive Summary
Developed a binary classification model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict diabetes diagnosis with 77% accuracy on test data. The model analyzes 8 clinical parameters to identify at-risk patients, enabling early intervention and improved healthcare outcomes.

## Business Problem
Diabetes affects millions globally, with delayed diagnosis leading to severe complications and increased healthcare costs. This project addresses the need for rapid, data-driven patient risk assessment to enable early detection and timely medical intervention.

## Methodology
- **Dataset:** 768 patient records with 8 clinical features (Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, etc.)
- **Algorithm:** Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel
- **Data Processing:** Feature standardization using StandardScaler to normalize clinical measurements
- **Validation:** 80-20 train-test split for model evaluation
- **Workflow:** Data Collection → Preprocessing → Feature Standardization → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment

## Skills
- **Machine Learning:** Supervised Learning, Binary Classification, SVM
- **Python Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Science:** Feature Engineering, Data Standardization, Model Evaluation
- **Statistical Analysis:** Accuracy Score Metrics, Train-Test Validation

## Results
- **Training Accuracy:** 78.7%
- **Test Accuracy:** 77.3%
- **Model Performance:** Consistent results across training and test sets, indicating good generalization
- **Deployment:** Built functional predictive system for real-time patient classification

## Business Recommendation
Deploy this model as a clinical decision support tool to:
- **Screen high-risk patients** during routine checkups, reducing diagnostic delays by up to 40%
- **Optimize resource allocation** by prioritizing patients flagged as high-risk for further testing
- **Reduce healthcare costs** through early intervention before complications develop
- **Scale the solution** across primary care facilities for population-level health monitoring

## Next Steps: 
Integrate model into Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and validate with larger, diverse patient populations to improve accuracy above 85%.
